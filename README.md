## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The game begins with a welcome note explaining the rules.  
2. You will be asked **50 questions**, one at a time.  
3. Each question has **four options (a, b, c, d)** — only one is correct.  
4. For every **10 correct answers**, you reach a **milestone** and win a guaranteed prize:
   | Milestone | Questions Reached | Prize Amount |
   |------------|------------------:|--------------:|
   | 1️⃣ | 10 | ₹1,000 |
   | 2️⃣ | 20 | ₹5,500 |
   | 3️⃣ | 30 | ₹10,500 |
   | 4️⃣ | 40 | ₹15,000 |
   | 5️⃣ | 50 | ₹25,000 |

5. After each milestone, you can choose to:
   - **Continue (Y)** → Move to the next set of questions  
   - **Quit (N)** → Go home with your current winnings  

6. A **wrong answer** ends the game immediately with the message:
   Wrong Answer
--BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME--
