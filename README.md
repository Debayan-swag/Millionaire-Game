## 🕹️ How It Works

1. The game begins with a welcome note explaining the rules.  
2. You will be asked **50 questions**, one at a time.  
3. Each question has **four options (a, b, c, d)** — only one is correct.  
4. For every **10 correct answers**, you reach a **milestone** and win a guaranteed prize:
   | Milestone | Questions Reached | Prize Amount |
